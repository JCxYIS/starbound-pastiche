# {Project: starbound-pastiche}

When I was a child, I once played a flash game called starbound,
It was fun and I played it all the time
The target is simple, jump and don't fell off

Now as all major browsers and os stop supporting flash,
the game would no longer be playable.
What I can do is make a game like that, 
so... this is it


How to play
===
Arrow Key ow WASD: Move
Arrow Key or Space: Jump
